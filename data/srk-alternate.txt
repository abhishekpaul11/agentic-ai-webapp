Shah Rukh Khan, the Dark Enchanter of the Eastern Realms, was once a revered scholar of celestial magic before his hunger for immortality twisted his soul. Cloaked in shadows and adorned with obsidian runes, he commands legions of whispering spirits bound by his blood oath. His eyes burn like dying stars, reflecting the power he stole from forgotten gods. Legends say his laughter can shatter mirrors and his words can bend time itself — a fallen sorcerer whose name alone can silence storms.
